# Monitoring and Alert

It's important to keep yours pipelines, loads healthy, so let's get alerted when a failure occurs

Grafana is a opensource tool that we can use to monitore and get alerted. In my case we use Kusto Query on Log Analytics to see if a pipeline have failure and send a teams notifications
There are 2 cenarios. First when a error will occur and second when a error occurred. Let's see.

Imagine when you want to use some table but in that moment the table isn't disponible, so you deactive it and send an alert to your team.
