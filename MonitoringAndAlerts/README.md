# Monitoring and Alert

It's important to keep yours pipelines, loads healthy, so let's get alerted when a failure occurs

## Grafana

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a opensource dashboard tool that we can use to monitore and get alerted. In my case we use [Kusto Query](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/tutorial?pivots=azuredataexplorer) on [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) to see if a pipeline have failure and send a teams notifications
There are 2 cenarios. First when a error will occur and second when a error occurred. Let's see.

* [Cenario 2]()

## Powerautomate

If you don't know what it is, see the documetation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/getting-started).

Imagine when you want to use some table but in that moment the table isn't disponible, so you deactive it and send an alert to your team.
